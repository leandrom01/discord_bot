# Discord bot

## Description

This is a really basic discord bot that uses discord.js. For now it just creates slash commands for a specific server but i have already implemented the bare bones for it to give all the servers (that the bot is in) the slash commands.

## Set up

First import all the packages using `npm i` or `npm install`. Both commands do the same.

Create a `config.json` where you put your token, clientId(application id) and guildId(server id).

Just like this:

```
{
  "token": "123456789",
  "clientId": "123456789",
  "guildId": "123456789"
}
```

## How to run

Run `node.js` in the terminal and that's it!.

## Want to upgrade it?

Just keep adding new '.js' files in the commands folder and thats all!
